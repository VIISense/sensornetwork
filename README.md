# sensornetwork

This code was written for my bachelor thesis:
This program simulate a binary tree as a network, where the nodes send messages to the root. 
In this simulation the enegery consumption should be minimized, which is a strongly NP-hard problem. 
There exists an approximation for this problem described and proofed in [Latency-Constrained Aggregation in Sensor Networks](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1644028)
